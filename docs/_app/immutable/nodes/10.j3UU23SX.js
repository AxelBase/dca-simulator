The DCA Simulator’s deterministic linear model makes validation straightforward through edge-case testing.</p> <h2 class="svelte-jo8es1">Zero Growth Validation</h2> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Set annual growth to zero percent and the asset price remains constant throughout. Units bought per period equal the fixed amount divided by the initial price. Total units become exactly the number of periods times units per buy. Average cost matches the initial price precisely, and final portfolio value equals total invested. This flat scenario provides an immediate sanity check.</p> <h3 class="svelte-jo8es1">Flat Price Example</h3> <ul class="svelte-jo8es1"><li class="svelte-jo8es1">Two hundred dollars weekly for twenty-six weeks</li> <li class="svelte-jo8es1">Initial price twenty-five dollars</li> <li class="svelte-jo8es1">Growth rate zero percent</li> <li class="svelte-jo8es1">Result: five thousand two hundred dollars invested equals exactly two hundred eight units at twenty-five dollars average cost</li></ul> <h3 class="svelte-jo8es1">High Growth Stress Test</h3> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Enter one hundred percent annual growth to simulate aggressive appreciation. The final price roughly doubles after one year, and average cost sits well below final price due to early lower-cost purchases. Portfolio value shows substantial gains, demonstrating how dollar-cost averaging captures upside in strong bull markets.</p> <h2 class="svelte-jo8es1">Negative Growth Scenarios</h2> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Use negative annual rates to model bear markets. Later periods buy at lower prices, increasing units acquired toward the end. Average cost may fall below initial price, while final value could be less than total invested depending on severity. These tests help understand behavior during downturns.</p> <h2 class="svelte-jo8es1">Cross-Verification Tips</h2> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Compare simulator results against manual calculations for short periods or simple spreadsheets for longer runs. The transparent linear formula ensures outputs match expectations every time. Export CSV data to verify totals independently when needed.</p> <h2 class="svelte-jo8es1">FAQ</h2> <details class="svelte-jo8es1"><summary class="svelte-jo8es1">Why test zero growth first?</summary> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">It eliminates price variation, making arithmetic verification immediate and exact.</p></details> <details class="svelte-jo8es1"><summary class="svelte-jo8es1">Can growth rates exceed one hundred percent?</summary> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Yes—enter any positive or negative value to explore extreme hypothetical markets.</p></details> <details class="svelte-jo8es1"><summary class="svelte-jo8es1">Do results ever have rounding errors?</summary> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Internal calculations use full precision; display rounding only affects presentation.</p></details> <p class="italic-note svelte-jo8es1">Trust your projections through simple, repeatable validation.</p></article></div>');function V(d){var e=T();j("jo8es1",h=>{var a=b(),m=v(g(a),6);s(4),r(()=>n(m,"content",`${c??""}/blog/posts/post7`)),f(()=>{y.title="Validating Results: Zero Growth & High-Return Tests | DCA Simulator Blog"}),o(h,a)});var t=i(e),u=i(t);s(4),l(t),s(2),l(e),r(()=>n(u,"href",`${c??""}/blog`)),o(d,e)}export{V as component,G as universal};
